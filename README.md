# BDD Exercise with Cucumber and Java

In this exercise we use gherkin scenarios with concise examples to describe the rules and the scenario outlines. The scenarios contain concreate outcomes that can be be checked automatically. 

The step definations have the Java code that run the scenarios and checks the outcomes. The actions have the Java code for the different actions for the different components for example loginActions or CartActions.   

The web application for this exercise was a test site https://www.saucedemo.com/.

There is a Cucumber Test suite Class for executing the tests. 

# Techniques Learned

When working on this exercise I learnt to run Cucumber tests from the Cucumber Test Suite Class or command line rather than the feature file.

I also learnt to "Ctrl +Click" with a cursor over a Class or method etc. to jump to the relevant details.  Ctrl + Click is not just for navigating from feature files to step definitions.
